<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<section id="about" aria-label="About Me">
  <h1>ABOUT_ME</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a Computer Science student passionate about web development, with a growing focus on backend technologies using Python.
    I enjoy building projects that combine solid backend logic with clean, user-friendly interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m learning Flask and plan to dive into Django next to strengthen my skills in Python-based backend development.
    I also have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working with databases, which helps me build full-stack applications at a foundational level.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve previously worked with platforms like Shopify to create and customize online stores using built-in tools and integrations.
    My main focus now is on developing my skills as a backend web developer and continuously improving through hands-on projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate.
